In this repo, I developed a website on COVID-19 Therapy using HTML,CSS and Bootstrap as a framework.

I have used a couple of libraries:
1) jQuery
2) GSAP - GreenSock (for animation)

To run this project, you just need to copy this repo to local system,
and run "index.html" file.

On index page, navigation to other pages are available.
